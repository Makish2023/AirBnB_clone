# AirBnB Clone 
The AirBnb clone is a copy of the official AirBnB website 
- incorporating a full web application 
- with a command interpreter to handle data without a visual interface.
- This includes a web front-end that displays both static and dynamic data
- a database to store data
- an api that provides a communication interface between the frontend and the data.
